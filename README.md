Voice-to-Text Transcriber

üì± About the App

This app is designed to test native voice recording and transcription capabilities on both iOS and Android devices. By leveraging the built-in speech recognition features of these platforms, it provides a versatile testing environment to explore and compare native transcription against API-based alternatives.

üéØ Objectives

Native Capability Exploration: Gain a deeper understanding of native voice recording and transcription features on iOS and Android.

Comparison Analysis: Compare the transcription accuracy and performance of native solutions with API-based offerings from Google Cloud and OpenAI.

AI Experimentation: Integrate AI models to summarize transcriptions and explore advanced prompt generation and contextual suggestions.

üîç Key Features

Voice Recording: Simple and intuitive interface to start and stop voice recording.

Native Transcription: Utilize platform-specific speech recognition for immediate transcription.

API-Based Transcription (Coming Soon): Planned support for Google Cloud and OpenAI API services for transcription.

AI Summarization (In Progress): Experiment with summarizing lengthy transcriptions using AI.

Prompt Generation: Explore creative and contextual prompt suggestions based on transcribed content.

ü§î Why I Built This

Understanding the full potential of native and API-based voice transcription is essential for many modern apps. With the growing reliance on AI-driven solutions, I wanted to create a sandbox to explore:

Native vs. API-based performance

Use cases for AI in summarizing transcriptions and generating actionable insights
